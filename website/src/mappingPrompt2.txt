Given databases with columns and sample values, merge them into one consistent schema. Output only a JSON string with a "unified_schema" (with "name" and "type") and "mappings". In "mappings", each entry should use the filename as the key, and map original column names to unified names as { original: unified }. Treat functionally identical or derivable columns as one, even if missing in some files.
