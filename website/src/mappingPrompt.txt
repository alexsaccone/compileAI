This is a collection of databases with all columns and some sample values included. These files should be mapped into one database while maintaining consistency and serve the purpose of the original databases.

Your output should ONLY be a JSON object in a parsable string that includes the "unified_schema" of the new database, which includes only "name" and "type", and how each file's columns should be mapped to the unified schema, which be called "mappings".

You should analyze which columns are functionally identical to one another and have only one column in the unified_schema for them. If data in a column can be calculated from data in other columns, account for this an treat files who might be mising columns as if they're there.
